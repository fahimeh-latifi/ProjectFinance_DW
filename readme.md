This project demonstrates a Data Warehouse designed for project-based financial tracking.  

**Note:** This project is a simulation for learning and portfolio purposes. All data and workflows are fictional and for demonstration only.

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a financial data warehouse designed for project-based tracking of revenue, expenses, labor cost, profit, and project progress.

It simulates a full OLTP-to-OLAP ETL pipeline including:

Dimension and Fact tables

Staging and ETL processes (Extract, Transform, Load)

Sample OLAP queries for reporting and analytics

Star schema design for high-performance query execution

The project highlights advanced data warehousing concepts and enterprise-ready reporting.

⭐ Star Schema Diagram

Fact Table: Fact_ProjectFinance
Metrics stored: Revenue, Expense, Labor_Cost, Profit, Hours_Worked, Progress_Percent

Dimension Tables:

Dim_Project → Project information

Dim_Employee → Employee details

Dim_Task → Task details

Dim_Time → Date/time hierarchy

Dim_CostCenter → Cost center information

🔄 ETL Pipeline Overview

Extract: Load raw OLTP data into Staging tables (Stage_*)

Transform: Clean, validate, and calculate metrics such as Profit and Progress

Load: Populate DW tables (Dim & Fact) from Staging

Reporting: Execute OLAP queries for project finance insights

Skills Demonstrated:

Data transformation and validation

ETL pipeline design

OLAP query optimization

Star schema design for analytics

🛠 Sample OLAP Queries

Total Expense, Revenue, and Profit per Project

Monthly Revenue & Profit Trends

Profit and Average Progress by Cost Center

Employee Contribution to Profit

Top 5 Tasks by Profit

For full query scripts, see sql/sample_queries.sql

📊 Data Source

Sample CSV files in data/ folder

Fact table initially has Profit = 0; calculated during ETL Transform step
